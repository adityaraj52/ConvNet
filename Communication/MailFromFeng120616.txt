Hello,

you should first try to install tensorflow, note that there are CPU and GPU versions for it:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html

here is a simple tutorial of tensorflow for beginners:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html

After reading the simple tutorial, you can try this for Image recognition(python part is ok):
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html
Then you can try to understand the source code in classify_image.py, it's based on the latest model
from Google named Inception-v3. The pdf for Inception-v3 is attached in this email.
You can extract higher level features from Inception-v3 for your own program.

To understand some concepts and definitions of convolutional neural networks, you can refer to Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network
or the notes from a Stanford course:
http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/
or here is a more simple version to introduce convolutional neural networks(maybe too simple, but good as an introduction for beginners)

Here is a website for playing with different parameters of neural networks:
http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.48488&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false

Other open source projects are:
CNTK from Microsoft
Theano from University of Montreal
Caffe from Berkeley

The above things are only suggestions, you can do what you like or read materials you are interested in.
wish you have fun!

best wishes,
Feng
