Dear Mrs. Pazouki,

Aditya Raj and me thought about doing our project on one of the listed competitions. The options are listed in our preferred order.

Do you think participating in one of the competitions and presenting the work to you is feasible for the course 'Neural Networks with Statistical Learning'?
We are not sure if the third competition is solvable via a neural net.
